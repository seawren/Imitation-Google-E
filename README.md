Alright, this seems to be working! At this point I've realized I've done the entire project backwards, creating a folder with git in it and then another one, and
so on, but I really don't care. I don't remember much about what I actually did for Google Easy. I do recall that trying to get my lists to float left and right
was really difficult for some reason. If I did this a second time I might try to use flexbox and clean up the code a bit. I think that's all, though.
